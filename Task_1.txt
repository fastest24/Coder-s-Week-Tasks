Hello Granny, how are you? I hope you're doing well during this time of panic. In any case, because of the current situation, I have a lot of free time on my hands, and I've decided to learn something very relevant and important in today's world. It's a way to make the computers understand what we want! And now I'm going to explain you how it works.

I know what you are going to say, how can I understand all this computer talk? Don't worry, I've come up with a solution for that. I'll explain it by using some personal memories I have. Pretty innovative, am I right? So, what Machine Learning (or ML) does is that it makes the computer listen to everything we tell it, and make its decisions based on that.

Like the time you taught me all about plants when I went for camping, and how I was able to tell the poisonous plants apart. ML basically makes the computer a very obedient grandson who will always do what you have taught it.
I also know what you're thinking right now. What is the use if it cannot do things without being told? That's the great thing about it, if we teach the computer well, it can do that too. Remember, when you used to teach me for my tests? You never told me the answer, just something related to it. ML makes the computer understand what we want it to do, without us actually telling it.

Such an amazing technology, right Granny?
And I've started to understand how to teach the computer too. By the time I come to visit you, I might be an expert on this topic. Who knows, maybe I'll teach some Machine Learning too. My only fear is that you don't overtake me in this too. Just kidding Granny. I hope you understood what Machine Learning does now and why it is so important. 

I'll tell you more about it when I see you next time. 
Goodbye!
